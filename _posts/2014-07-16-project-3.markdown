description: As a solo developer, I programmed all of the game systems, designed the mechanics, created animations, wrote custom shaders, and worked with contractors to add more detail to the game environment. In order to test some game mechanics, I programmed an AI that uses machine learning concepts to learn how to play the game. I also created tools using Unity editor scripting to increase efficiency in animation, character creation, and UI development.
