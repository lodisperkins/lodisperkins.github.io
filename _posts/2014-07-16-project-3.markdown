description: As a solo developer, I generated all of the content with the exception of some art assets. In order to test some game mechanics, I programmed an AI that uses a modified version of monte carlo tree search to learn how to play the game. I also created tools using Unity editor scripting to increase efficiency in animation, character creation, and UI development.
