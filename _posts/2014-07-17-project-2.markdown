description: Grid Game is a player versus player tower defense. Players battle on a 4 by 10 grid in an attempt to either destroy either their opponent, or the object behind their opponent. A notable addition I gave to this is an AI that strategizes and moves as a player does. It finds weak points, targets support systems, and attacks opponenings while trying to prevent its own defense from weakening. The game is also made using some helper tools I wrote using Unity's editor scripting including a custom event system and input manager. This is a solo project.
